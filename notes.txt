128 transcript: 
Has some non-ascii characters
Has spanish, non quite suitable
Uses dash "-" as both an orthographic character and a discourse metacharacter
Line 671: "I didnï¿½t realize", not sure why the tick doesn't render properly 
Would be very help to have time stamps - if not for words, for speaker transitions. There is no mapping from word to speaker
